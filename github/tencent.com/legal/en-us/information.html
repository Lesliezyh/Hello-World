            <div class="news-content default-skin">
            	<img src="../images/information/news/news_10/1-en.png"/ style="width: auto;">
                <br/>
                <p>On June 5, 2018, the Business Software Alliance (BSA) released the “2018 Global Software Survey Report.” When compared with the results of the global software survey conducted by the BSA in 2016, the utilization rate of pirated software in China dropped by 4% from 70% to 66%.  During the period from 2014 to 2016, the utilization rate of pirated software in China also decreased from 74% to 70%, representing a decrease of 4%.  The two consecutive survey reports indicate that the utilization rate of pirated software in China has reduced by 8% during this 4-year period, and these global surveys show that China is the country that made the most improvement in reducing the use of pirated software.  Software plays an important role in the internationalization of enterprises.  Software can help businesses improve their business model, increase profits, expand to new markets and obtain competitive advantages.  However, against this backdrop of internationalization, protecting intellectual property rights remains an issue during the course of internalization of software enterprises.  Furthermore, Mr. Victor Jiang, the General Manager of the Legal Affairs Department at Tencent, expressed his views on the intellectual property rights issues faced by enterprises and the potential solutions.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Mr. Jiang said, “When Chinese software enterprises go abroad, they usually encounter legal actions taken by non-practicing entities (NPE), which are entities that mainly operate by suing other companies for patent infringement.  Tencent’s WeChat and game software have also encountered such NPEs.”  As such, Tencent is gradually perfecting its own patent strategy.  He added, “Tencent has applied for over 20,000 patents in more than 40 countries and regions, most of which are patents for invention, in order to form a defense network to protect its key products.  Tencent has also established partnerships with some overseas enterprises and organizations that have high-quality patents in order to further mitigate the risk of being attacked by NPEs.” </p>
                <br/>
                <p>When establishing its intellectual property rights strategy, Tencent is not only forming a professional defense network in the field of patents, but it is also making full use of trademarks to offer greater protection to the company during its internationalization process.  Mr. Jiang pointed out, “The protection strategy for trademarks is different from that of patents.  In addition to the defensive measures, the preventive and forward-looking measures are more critical for the protection of intellectual property rights.  With the increasing number of products that expand into overseas markets, each product will encounter the issue of whether its trademarks are in compliance with the local laws and regulations when it enters into each territory.  To cope with this situation and be well-prepared, enterprises are advised to formulate a trademark strategy, to sort out the basic information of trademarks in the industry of various territories and to have an understanding of the laws and regulations of the territories where the products are launched; this understanding should include the types, names and forms of trademarks that can be registered in those territories.”</p>
                <br/>
                <p>In addition to protection of their own intellectual property rights, global enterprises should also pay attention to avoiding disputes when bringing its software abroad.  Mr. Jiang believes, “Each country has different trademark and copyright requirements.  A product may be considered lawful under Chinese laws, but the same product may infringe third party rights overseas.”  In the case of a product with cultural attributes, the examination procedures for bring such product abroad may be more stringent, and disputes may arise more easily.</p>

            	<p>Intellectual property rights are a two-sided sword for the internalization of enterprises.  Such rights are an important protection tool for enterprises on the one hand, but also a main reason for the increase of legal risk of enterprises on the other.  Enterprises should perfect their intellectual property strategy and fully utilize their intellectual property rights during their internalization process, thus providing adequate legal protection for their international operations.</p>

            <span class="news-date">Date: July 18, 2018</span>
            <div class="news-content default-skin">
                <p>The Weixin team of Tencent held a conference for the protection of brand owners on Weixin in Guangzhou on March 13, 2018, publishing the “Weixin Report on Protection of Brand Owners” and the recent achievements as a result of optimization of the Weixin Brand Protection Platform.  Through optimization, the Weixin Brand Protection Platform is fully digitalized and is made available to all brand owners to submit their applications.  Mr. Brent Irvin, Vice President and General Counsel of Tencent, Mr. Leo Xie, General Manager of the Legal Affairs Platform Department of Tencent, and others attended the conference and delivered important speeches.</p>
                <br/>
                <img src="../images/information/news/news_9/1-en.png"/ style="width: auto;">
                <br/>
                <p>Mr. Irvin, made concise speeches on relevant matters such as the background of the publication of the “Weixin Report on Protection of Brand Owners” and Weixin’s current status on brand protection. Mr. Irvin emphasized that Weixin, as a social media product, has no motive to facilitate the spread of counterfeit goods. However, as a matter of practicality, with the huge number of users on social media platforms and the great difficulties in managing contents, there are still a large number of users that use the Weixin platform to sell counterfeit goods. He said, “This is very harmful to our production of contents. As Weixin has an enormous amount of traffic and we have actually sold our e-commerce business to JD.com, we thought at that time that the problem in this regard will no longer exist after the sale of the e-commerce business.”  In order to resolve brand protection issues, Tencent’s legal team did a lot of work in this aspect.  Mr. Irvin highlighted that Tencent places great importance on brand protection. In the future, the Weixin team will enhance its efficiency in handling complaints and will provide more accessible tools to brand owners.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Mr. Xie, gave a speech on the specific issues relating to brand protection on Weixin. Mr. Xie noted that “unlike e-commerce platforms such as Taobao and JD.com, Weixin, as an integrated social media communication tool, it encounters some unique difficulties in its brand protection practices. For instance, one such difficulty exists in preventing brand infringement within Moments (a feature within Weixin). It is not only difficult for brand owners to identify any infringing content, but Weixin’s lack of capability of verifying branded products also contributes to the difficulties for both making complaints and verifying infringements.  Due to the aforesaid difficulties, Weixin’s brand protection team has decided to change its traditional handling method of “complaint by brand owners – reaction by network services providers” by introducing users as an essential component for brand protection. This means that not only can brand owners lodge complaints, but users can also simultaneously provide leads in relation to the sale of counterfeit goods to the Platform and brand owners.  Upon receipt of such leads by brand owners, they may verify relevant leads using their professional verification methods. If indeed there is any infringement of legitimate rights of a brand owner, such brand owner can inform Weixin immediately to take actions.” Mr. Xie pointed out that Weixin has established a comprehensive and convenient online IP infringement complaint system that covers both Weixin official accounts and Weixin personal accounts. The infringement complaint system can achieve digitization of complaint information, tracking of the complaint process, high efficiency of processing complaints and transparency of processing results. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>According to “Weixin Report on Protection of Brand Owners,” up until 2017, the Platform has provided brand protection support for 186 domestic and foreign enterprises from 18 countries and regions covering more than 400 domestic and overseas well-known trademarks. The Platform has, on a cumulative basis, sent out over 120,000 valid infringement leads to brand owners and has taken measures against more than 72,000 infringing accounts. </p>

            <h4 class="news-title news-title-3">Brent Irvin: Copyright Protection in China and the Evolution of Copyright-Related Transactions</h4>
            <span class="news-date">Date: April 9, 2018</span>
            <div class="news-content default-skin">
                <p>The 6th Annual Peking-Oxford-Stanford University Internet Law and Public Policy Conference was held successfully at Stanford University on December 4, 2017.  Brent Irvin, General Counsel of Tencent Group, attended the conference and delivered a keynote speech.</p>
                <br/>
                <img src="../images/information/news/news_8/1.png"/ style="width: auto;">
                <br/>
                <p>The conference focused on four topics: Copyright protection in China and the evolution of copyright-related transactions, patent developments in China and the United States, the Internet and economic development, and antitrust in the Internet environment.  Over 20 leading experts and scholars from around the world attended the conference and explored these topics.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>With respect to the enforcement and development of copyright law in China, Mr. Irvin, General Counsel of Tencent Group, highlighted Tencent’s strategic adjustment, content related transactions, the development of intellectual property derivative works, and rights protection, as well as other issues.</p>
                <br/>
                <p><b>I. Strategic Adjustment: from a Social Network and Game Company to an Internet Media Platform</b></p>
                <br/>
                <p>Over the past few years, Tencent has gradually transformed from a company focused on social networking and games to an Internet media platform providing online content such as video, games, music and Internet literature.  The strategic adjustment of Tencent is driven, to a certain degree, by particular economic, social and legal factors. </p>
                <p>First, in relation to economic factors, Tencent shifted from a business model relying on advertising revenues to one featuring numerous independent online transactions. The progression of Internet literature, along with the popularity of online reading, and QQ Music in China, contributed to the emergence of both profitable and independent business segments relying on such independent online transactions, and are examples of the changes that facilitated Tencent’s transformation.</p>
                <p>Second, in relation to social factors, China progressed into the mobile Internet era.  Online payments and content consumption can be all achieved through cell phones. China has outpaced the US and Europe in this respect.  Tencent’s strategic positioning was influenced by more users having portable Internet access, which allowed them to consume online content via their mobile services.  </p>
                <p>Third, in relation to legal factors, five years ago, when Tencent set its strategic focus on content such as music, films and literature, the company had recognized the need for monetization of such content due to the tremendous costs for acquiring the intellectual property rights to such content. In particular, monetization of the content required copyright protection.  As the then landscape of copyright protection in China had improved, Tencent was capable of promoting copyright protection, and thus Tencent established a strong copyright protection team comprising of in-house attorneys and an effective copyright protection system with copyright monitoring software.  Tencent made strategic adjustments and shifted its focus to content based on all the aforementioned factors, the absence of which would have made the adjustment impossible.</p>
                <p>In addition, Tencent has been cooperating with record labels to combat against piracy for years, and has established good relationship with such labels.  In the past when China’s music industry lacked regulation and oversight, pirated products were rampant, and profits of this industry mainly came from TV programs or concerts, both of which had less significant consumption markets.  For artists, such limited sources of profits dampened diversified music creation, and therefore, consumers did not have a selection of diversified musical works to enjoy.  Over the past few years, copyright protection has been improved immensely by counter-piracy and counter-plagiarism efforts.  As a result, the music industry in China is now developing soundly with constant innovative exploitations of music works.  Strengthened copyright enforcement plays an important role in the development of China’s music industry.</p>
                <br/>
                <p><b>II. Rights of Derivative Works:  Remedies for Infringements of Copyrights + Trademark Rights</b></p>
                <br/>
                <p>Tencent develops derivative works of IP through various platforms, such as adapting a film from a game, or producing a video game or other derivative works based on a science fiction piece.  Although the copyright law in China will generally provide protection to derivative works, there are, inevitably, certain grey areas in connection with such derivative exploitations.  This is not an issue that is unique to China, and is a concern also shared by the US, Europe and various other countries.</p>
                <p>To address this, when adapting a novel into a video game, or adapting a video game to a film, in addition to copyright protection, Tencent will also supplement such protection by registering relevant trademarks. For instance, in relation to game adaptation, Tencent registers not only game titles but also specific game elements as trademarks.  In the last few years, Tencent has been the applicant filing the largest number of trademark applications around the world.  With respect to grey areas, such as the unauthorized use of Tencent’s copyrighted content in TV programs, Tencent will first look to copyright laws for protection, and failing such, Tencent will further pursue protection from trademark laws.  Such a strategy has been proven to be effective. </p>
                <br/>
                <p><b>III. Copyright Protection Supports Content Transactions, Diversified Creation and Derivative Exploitations</b></p>
                <br/>
                <p>Strengthening of copyright protection greatly incentivizes content related transactions, diversified creation of copyrighted work and derivative exploitations of copyright.  Today, consumers in China can gain access to content at relatively lower prices through a wide variety of channels.  Based on the improvement of the copyright environment, a business model where enterprises acquire intellectual property rights and monetizes them is beneficial to users, allowed users diversified channels for access and also incentivizing content creators to create a diversified portfolio, thereby enhancing cultural benefits to the entire society.</p>

            <span class="news-date">Date: June 12, 2017</span>
            <div class="news-content default-skin">
                <p>
                	On April 15, 2017, the 14th annual Nanhu Forum on Intellectual Property Rights, with a focus on “New Developing Ideas and Intellectual Property Rights Rule of Law Modernization,” was held in Shanghai.  The forum was guided by the State Intellectual Property Office and co-sponsored by the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law and the Shanghai Institute of Technology.
                </p>
                <p style="color: rgb(62, 62, 62); white-space: normal; line-height: 1.75em; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-right: 0.5em; letter-spacing: 1px;"><br></p>
                <img src="../images/information/news/news_7/1.webp" style="width: auto;">
                <p style="color: rgb(62, 62, 62); white-space: normal; line-height: 1.75em; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-right: 0.5em; letter-spacing: 1px;"><br></p>
                <p>
                	Mr. Brent Irvin, Vice President and General Counsel of Tencent, was invited to deliver a keynote speech at the event. Mr. Irvin pointed out that the Nanhu Forum, with more than 10 years of history, has become a tremendously influential international platform for the exchange on academic intellectual property issues providing opportunities for peers in intellectual property related industries to exchange with and to learn from each other. 
                </p>
                <p style="color: rgb(62, 62, 62); white-space: normal; line-height: 1.75em; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-right: 0.5em; letter-spacing: 1px;"><br></p>
                <p>
                	Mr. Irvin stated in his speech that China’s intellectual property protection environment is better than many people think. He elaborated with an example of copyright protection in the digital content industry and indicated that, in recent years, this industry has witnessed a seminal breakthrough in terms of copyright protection, and that intellectual property protection has been secured in almost all business segments in the industry, including video, music and literature platforms. Piracy problems that have long afflicted the industry have been mostly resolved. This, according to Mr. Irvin, is of critical importance. Moreover, China’s current overall intellectual property protection environment can support a paid content business model, which was unimaginable five years ago. 
                </p>
                <p style="color: rgb(62, 62, 62); white-space: normal; line-height: 1.75em; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-right: 0.5em; letter-spacing: 1px;"><br></p>
                <p>
                	Nevertheless, Mr. Irvin also indicated room for improvement despite such progress. He noted that China could incorporate other countries’ valuable experiences in establishing a perfect intellectual property protection system. Mr. Irvin took trademarks and patents as examples to illustrate his point. Trademark squatting remains a serious issue in China. While large corporations may have sufficient resources to cope with such issues, medium and small companies fall victim to trademark squatting, which hinders start-ups, innovation, and the development of such companies. Mr. Irvin conceded that trademark squatting was a difficult issue to address, and he hoped that discussions at the Nanhu Forum would lead to solutions. 
                </p>
                <p style="color: rgb(62, 62, 62); white-space: normal; line-height: 1.75em; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-right: 0.5em; letter-spacing: 1px;"><br></p>
                <p>
                	Mr. Irvin took patent trolls as another example. Noting that the term “patent troll” is not neutral in itself, he stated that patents are an important driving force for innovation in relation to the Internet, but they should be considered in the context of the overall environment. For example, in the U.S., many attorneys do not regard patents as a driving force for innovation in the U.S. Internet industry, and many even blame them as a hindrance because of enormous litigation costs. Mr. Irvin mentioned in his speech that this perspective might be quite controversial, but the crux was that China should incorporate desirable experiences while drawing lessons from other countries in its patent management efforts. 
                </p>
                <p style="color: rgb(62, 62, 62); white-space: normal; line-height: 1.75em; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-right: 0.5em; letter-spacing: 1px;"><br></p>
                <p>
                	According to Mr. Irvin, intellectual property innovation and protection has become a core task of Tencent’s legal team through years of development. In order for the general public to better understand the concept and rules in connection with intellectual property protection carried out by Tencent’s platforms, Tencent’s legal team has devoted a tremendous amount of time and effort in drafting the “Tencent Intellectual Property White Paper,” which will be published in the Internet sub-forum of the Nanhu Forum, with an aim to raise the awareness of the public to intellectual property and legal issues arising in the rapid and innovative development of the Internet industry, and to promote an orderly development of the Internet industry through open communications.

            <span class="news-date">Date: 2015-12-17</span>
            <div class="news-content default-skin">
                <p>
                	On December 17, 2015,Brent Irvin, Vice President and General Counsel of Tencent Holdings Limited, attended the 2nd World Internet Conference-Internet Innovation Forum, and gave a keynote speech on innovation and protection of intellectual property rights in the internet industry. Below is the transcript of the speech:
                </p>
                <img src="../images/information/news/news7-1.jpg"/>
                <p>
                	<b>1. Innovation in the Internet Space has Changed the Way We Live</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                	The topic we discuss today is extremely relevant. It is undeniable that innovation in the internet space has changed the way we interact and socialize. We can now book a taxi online through a few clicks. We also have a plethora of mobile apps that have transformed the ways that we connect with our friends, manage our finances, buy products, and watch TV and movies as compared to 10 years ago. Companies like Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, Xiaomi, Microsoft, and Didi have contributed many  disruptive technologies. 
                </p>
				<img src="../images/information/news/news7-2.png"/>
                <p>
                	Tencent provides a complete ecosystem serving various aspects of our everyday lives. For our social and entertainment needs, QQ and WeChat provide social networks, games, videos, music, literature, news, sports, and other content. Meanwhile, for our technical and financial needs, Tencent provides tools such as QQ Browser, QQpay, QQ Guanjia, and Tencent Maps. In addition, through cooperation with our partners such as 360buy, Dianping, Sougou, 58, and Didi, Tencent provides even more avenues to access services over the internet. 
                </p>
				<img src="../images/information/news/news7-3.png"/>
				<p>
					<b>2. Intellectual Property Rights Stimulate and Protect Growth</b>
				</p>
                <p>
                	What is the relationship between innovation and intellectual property rights? As the general counsel of Tencent, I believe these are closely related to our legal department’s work. Intellectual property protection is one of the most important factors in innovation in the internet industry, not only to Tencent, but also to other internet companies such as Baidu, Alibaba, and Sohu.
                </p>
                <p>
                	In fact, many of my foreign friends have misconceptions about China’s intellectual property rights regime.  I joined Tencent six years ago and protection of intellectual property rights in China has vastly improved during that period. Piracy has been effectively curbed. In recent years, China’s digital content industry has undergone significant reforms. Enforcement of intellectual property rights has strengthened significantly. Many companies actively participate in intellectual property protection and have set up an industry coalition to promote genuine content on the internet. 
                </p>
				<img src="../images/information/news/news7-4.png"/>
                <p>
                	We work extensively with foreign companies such as HBO and the NBA and invest tremendous amounts to license high quality copyrighted content. We also established a comprehensive copyright enforcement system, with over 20 lawyers dedicated to enforcing intellectual property rights in videos, music, games, comics,  animation, news, and WeChat. The removal rate of pirated content after we initiate a take down request is over 99%.  To date, we have effected the removal of more than 1.22 million pirated links.
                </p>				
                <p>
                	Notwithstanding the great strides we have made in protection of intellectual property in China, there are still challenges in the future and room for improvement. Nevertheless, the general trend is still very positive. 
                </p>
                <img src="../images/information/news/news7-5.png"/>
                <p>
                	Trademark protection is another important area to our business, especially as our mobile games and WeChat platform have grown tremendously. Tencent operates numerous high-quality games, such as Tiantiankupao and Tiantianaixiaochu of the “Tiantian Series,” all of which need trademark protection. To date, Tencent has applied for more than 14,000 trademarks and has established an exceptional trademark protection system. 
                </p>
                <img src="../images/information/news/news7-6.png"/>
                <p>
                	Furthermore, for both internet companies and software companies, patent protection is vital to the growth of the companies. Without patents, innovation cannot be effectively protected. As with our foreign peers, Chinese internet companies such as Tencent, Baidu, and Alibaba have invested heavily in patent protection and strategy. Microsoft has a strong global patent portfolio, and Google has made substantial patent acquisitions. Tencent has also emphasized the importance of patent protection. We have applied for more than 15,000 patents globally, more than any other Chinese internet company. Tencent has also won the National Patent Gold Award three times, a prestigious award jointly selected by the National Intellectual Property Bureau and WIPO.
                </p>
                <p>
                	<b>3. Challenges and Difficulties of Protecting Intellectual Property Rights</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                	Now, I would liketalk about several specific issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                	Tencent recognizes the importance of patent protection in the internet industry.However, one area that I hope China will not follow in the footsteps of the US is the prevalence of patent trolls. In recent years, there has been a marked increase in NPE cases globally. Such cases are often expensive to defend.
                </p>
                <p>
                	In many ways, the US patent system has created an environment that fosters patent trolls and NPEs, which does not encourage and may even stifle innovation. Recently, Tencent was sued by a patent troll in a case involving Tencents online games. I think many companies, such as Microsoft, will also have similar problems with NPEs which may harm innovation. Large companies like Tencent and Microsoft have the resources to combat patent trolls, but for start-up companies, the consequences can be dire. 
                </p>
                <img src="../images/information/news/news7-7.png"/>
                <p>
                	NPEs have begun filing and obtaining patents in China as well. I hope China can learn from the US and find ways to effectively combat patent troll litigation. 
                </p>
                <p>
                	Another issue related to patents is the more technical question of whether open platforms should incur patent liability arising from third party products or services that use the platforms. This is also a worldwide problem. How do we determine the liability of platforms, which essentially provide an information service? In our opinion, patents differ from copyrights and it is difficult for internet platforms to determine if a certain product infringes patent rights.  This is a complex problem even for courts. If a patent troll notifies Tencent and claims that someone is selling a product on WeChat that infringes its patent rights, how would Tencent decide if such claim is true? I believe that the traditional notice-take down procedure for copyright cannot directly apply to patent rights. The remedy for patent infringement in the internet space should be a preliminary injunction. 
                </p>
                <img src="../images/information/news/news7-8.png"/>
                <p>
                	Trademark is another issue. Tencent’s trademark group has invested significant time and resources applying for trademarks and procuring trademark protection. Nevertheless, we continue to see serious problems with trademark squatting. As opposed to the “first use” system in Europe and the US, China employs the “first to file” system. Meanwhile, the cost of trademark applications and the threshold for trademark registration is low. As a result, many people in China squat on trademarks in order to make a profit. There are tens of millions of apps in China, and each of them needs a name.  Many developers find it hard to choose a name for products because many names have already been registered by trademark squatters. We hope that in the future Chinese courts and the trademark bureau will be more proactive in maintaining the integrity of the trademark system.

            <h4 class="news-title">Victor Jiang of Tencent: Laws should Evolve to Combat Infringement Arising from Integrated Linking</h4>
            <span class="news-date">Date: 2016-08-20</span>
            <div class="news-content default-skin">
                <p>
                	“The era of infringement 3.0 has been characterized by the complete separation of the online webpage, media player, and data storage service.” As such, Victor Jiang, General Manager of Tencent’s legal department, believes that the criteria for determining copyright infringement over the internet should evolve alongside social and technological developments rather than being confined to outdated “server/client” based standards. 
                </p>
                <img src="../images/information/news/news8-1.jpg"/>
                <p>
                	On August 20 in Beijing, China, the Chinese Copyright Association held a seminar on “Mobile Applications and Advertisement Related Copyright Infringement.”  Delegates from copyright enforcement agencies, judges specializing in intellectual property, and representatives from the digital media industry participated in the seminar. Victor Jiang, General Manager of Tencent’s legal department, gave a speech on behalf of Internet Video Genuine Alliance.  The Alliance consists of members from the digital media industry such as Tencent, iQiyi, Youku-Tudou, and Sohu.  The Alliance’s mission is to promote genuine content within the industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                	In his keynote speech “Industry Regulation and Legal Cooperation in the Era of Internet Infringement 3.0,” Victor Jiang argued that infringement on the internet can be divided into three stages. The features of the infringement 1.0 and infringement 2.0 stages were “integration of webpage and media player and server” and “separation of webpage and media player and server,” respectively. In the era of infringement 3.0, copyright infringement on the internet has developed to include new features, such as integrated linking, online file hosting services and small piracy sites. To combat the rise of these features, copyright protection needs to evolve with respect to industry regulation and legal cooperation. 
                </p>
                <p>
                	<b>New Forms of Infringement in Era 3.0</b>
                </p>                   
                <p>
                	Victor Jiang said that new forms of infringement have emerged in the era of Infringement 3.0.  Such forms include integrated linking sites and aggregators, online file hosting services, small piracy sites, and illegal resource sites.
                </p>
                <p>
                	Integrated linking sites and aggregators, in conjunction with mobile devices and smart TVs, have enabled the development of apps that are able to illegally distribute content to large audiences.  These apps, by leveraging media player nesting, targeted linking, integrated linking, deep-linking technology, and media player platforms, are able to offer content from throughout the internet without advertisements or other compensation to the copyright holders of the content.  As such, these apps provide copyrighted content in a manner that exceed the usual scope of conventional search engines.	
                </p>
                <p>
                	Victor Jiang emphasized that such linking sites and aggregators cause severe harm to exclusive distribution rights, and impair the intellectual property protection and business models of authorized video websites. More importantly, integrated linking sites and aggregators have hampered the growth of business for the digital media industry around the world. 
                </p>
                <p>
                	In addition, infringement by file hosting services cannot be ignored. Currently, the data sharing function of many online file hosting services has changed from its core function (data backup) to propagating illegal distribution of content. Online file hosting services have become vital hubs for illegal resource sites to store and facilitate the illegal distribution of content.  Such is the case because many file hosting services lack effective control systems, which frequently lead to the uncontrolled distribution of illegal content.
                </p>
                <p>
                	Along with China’s strengthening of internet copyright enforcement, the number of large piracy websites have declined. However, piracy over smaller websites continues to be rampant. Victor Jiang pointed out that these smaller piracy and illegal resources websites generally lack any sort of authorization to distribute copyrighted content and have not implemented content review systems.  As a consequence, content over such smaller websites are often distributed without any sort of control, which distorts the traditional copyright market order.
                </p>
                <p>
                	Victor Jiang called special attention to small piracy and illegal resource sites that adopt a fragmented infringement model where the website, media player, and storage server are physically separated.  Such separation has made copyright enforcement with respect to these sites difficult.  In particular, infringement by these smaller piracy and illegal resource sites are usually subtle and hard to discover because the sites do not need to invest significantly in bandwidth or servers. Rather, they leverage online file hosting services to distribute files and social networks, bulletin board systems, and Baidu Tieba to publish information that direct users to the locations at which the content is stored over the online file hosting services. 
                </p>
                <p>
                	<b>Urge for Industry Regulation and Legal Coordination</b> 
                </p>
                <p>
                	Focusing on the features of infringement 3.0, Victor Jiang believes that coordination of technology, industry, and laws is necessary. Copyright laws must respond to new issues created by industry and technology, and curtail technologies that lack creativity and damage the copyright system. Such actions by the legislature and courts would provide positive feedback to the development of the industry and technology. 
                </p>
                <p>
                	Fighting against integrated linking sites and aggregators is a new challenge for anti-piracy efforts. On behalf of the Internet Video Genuine Alliance, Victor Jiang urged for enhancements to judicial protections of content.  Specifically, legal linking services should be required to satisfy all the following conditions: (1) provide information for the source website, (2) display the entirety of the website, (3) completely direct to the source, and (4) leave the platform after redirection. Deep linking and integrated linking sites and aggregators cannot be seen as equivalent to traditional search engines. Rather, their actions should constitute direct infringement; we should not persist with outdated criteria to determine infringement.
                </p>
                <p>
                	Victor Jiang also spoke about establishing fair and consistent entrance criteria to the digital media industry. Integrated video platforms should, like other video websites, obtain applicable permits such as the internet culture business permit and the permit for transmission of online audiovisual content. Otherwise, they should not engage in businesses such as providing and transmitting content. 
                </p>
                <p>
                	Meanwhile, app store operators should review the qualifications of apps and establish a blacklist system. No app on the blacklist should be distributed by the app store and apps which have received infringement complaints should be promptly taken down and cannot be reinstated until infringement issues have been resolved.
                </p>
                <p>
                	In addition, Victor Jiang believed that it is necessary to strengthen the crackdown of illegal content stored online.  In particular, hefty punishment should be imposed on online file hosting services that facilitate illegal activities. The function of online file hosting services needs to be regulated; it may even be necessary to eliminate the sharing functionality of online file hosting services. With respect to setting up an enforcement system, online file hosting services should be required to perform strict reviews of uploaded content and establish mechanisms for blocking content determined to be illegal or pirated.
                </p>
                <p>
                	With respect to small piracy websites and illegal resource sites, Victor Jiang thinks that administrative and criminal liabilities should be imposed for infringing and criminal behavior. Advertising should also be regulated and a blacklist should be established. Advertisers should not cooperate with websites on the blacklist in order to cut the revenue streams for small piracy and illegal resource sites.
                </p>
                <p>
                	From the perspective of internet service providers, Victor Jiang suggests that search engine companies should also establish a blacklist system by blocking illegal websites on the blacklists and not providing integrated linking services. Browsers should also block illegal websites on the blacklists and not provide website directing services so that such websites cannot be opened via the browser.

                   Recently, the phrase "IP Superpower" has been hitting the headlines a lot in China.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "The Making of an IP Superpower" was also the theme at the recently-closed 2015 Intellectual Property South Lake Forum. Scholars and experts at the Forum agreed that China's priority is to define a detailed action plan for becoming an IP Superpower.
                </p>

                <p class="sub-title">
                    A nation built on innovation and the rule of law.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Since the Reform and Opening-Up, China has led the world on various indicators relating to patents, trademarks and copyrights. Quantitatively China is without a doubt an IP Superpower. But quality-wise China still has a long way to go." Mr. Changyu Shen said. Mr. Shen is Director of the State Intellectual Property Office.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Late 2014, the State Council issued the Action Plan for the National Intellectual Property Strategy (2014-2020) (the "Action Plan"), which clearly stated China's goal to become an IP Superpower.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What is an IP Superpower? Professor Handong Wu of Zhongnan University of Economics and Law told the Legal Daily, "It is an advanced country that facilitates innovation through a proper intellectual property system. An IP Superpower should be a nation built on innovation and the rule of law."
                </p>

                <p class="sub-title">
                    Brand Competitiveness Ranked Top Ten in the World
                </p>

                <p>
                    A series of conditions are required for the making of an IP Superpower.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "In my opinion, whether a country is an IP Superpower depends on several conditions, including its legal system, industrial development, environmental management, and culture." Professor Handong Wu said.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mr. Jinchuan Wang said: "I would like to emphasize that, when designing the key objectives, we must highlight conditions related to economic and social development."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mr. Jinchuan Wang said: "I would like to emphasize that, when designing the key objectives, we must highlight conditions related to economic and social development."
                </p>

                <p>
                    These conditions include the following:
                    1. China must live up to international standards in terms of how much of its innovative technology is protected with intellectual property;<br />
                    2. China must significantly increase the extent by which IP rights are implemented and used for industrial purposes;<br />
                    3. China must live up to international standards in terms of how IP-intensive industries contribute to its social and economic growth, including how much these industries contribute to GDP growth, and how much these industries help with employment; 
                </p>

                <p>
                    China must significantly increase the overall performance of IP rights, so that Chinese products and services are competitive on a global level.
                </p>

                <p class="sub-title">
                    Key Objective: an Effective and Efficient IP Judiciary
                </p>

                <p>
                    To build an IP Superpower, a good judiciary is certainly a necessary condition.
                </p>

                <p>
                    According to Mr. Kesheng Jin, Vice Director of the Third Department of the Civil Division of the Supreme People's Court, "An effective and efficient judiciary is one of the key conditions to becoming an IP Superpower. An IP-proficient judiciary plays several roles: not only can it resolve disputes with efficiency, by interpreting laws and issuing regulations, the judiciary can also contribute to the nation's intellectual property regime and technical innovations, and have an direct impact on the global IP landscape. " 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over the past few years, Chinese courts have handled a number of high profile cases, including the competition dispute between Qihoo and Tencent, the standard essential patent dispute between Huawei and IBC, the iPad trademark ownership dispute, among others.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mr. Jin said "Chinese courts have obtained global recognition through properly resolving disputes and interpreting the law. However, we still have much room for improvement when compared with some of the more developed IP regimes in Europe and America. So far we've only played a limited role in setting the rules for cross-border IP protection.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Going forward, Chinese courts will have a greater impact on effective IP protection through. The judiciary should also play a more active role in supervising administrative actions relating to intellectual property, including through judicial reviews of IP applications and grants. Courts should consider an action plan for improving IP protection, focusing on maintaining consistency and accuracy in the application and interpretation of the law, and on drawing lessons from judicial policies and established guiding cases.

                    Restrain Online Piracy with Law and Self-Regulation
                </p>

                <p>
                    In order to become an IP Superpower, China must also fully develop its Internet industry.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mr. Bo Jiang, General Manager of Tencent’s legal department, proposed the concept of "Internet + Copyright", and stated that "Internet + Copyright" would be a catalyst for the prosperity and development of the content industry, and would help to build a greater eco-system for Internet copyright.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In recent years, Internet companies have invested increasing amounts into the acquisition and development of copyright content. This in turn has increased the value of Internet copyright content. For example, the market value of the online games industry reached RMB 114.95 billion in 2014.The Internet has also become a preferred channel for the launch of new copyright content. Many books and movies which were not published in traditional channels have achieved great success over the Internet. Internet will play an increasingly important and direct role in the development of the content industry, and the evolution of new copyright materials.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mr. Jiang suggested that, in order to develop the content industries in the age of the Internet, piracy must be restrained through law and self-regulation. He said "although we have faith in the development of the content industry, we still need to be vigilant against online piracy. To tackle internet piracy, we need the participation of a wide range of organizations and individuals, including the legislature, the judiciary, administrative institutions and the rights holders. These parties need to communicate and cooperate with each other. Companies are also growing their own IP enforcement teams, facilitating the healthy development of the industry. "
                </p>

                    Mr. Jiang also argued that the "Cross-platform Entertainment" eco-system in the industry is an innovative way for the operation and development of the copyright industry in the Internet + era. Cross-platform Entertainment, in Tencent's experience, refers to the collection of games, manga, anime, literature, and films as interconnected platforms, rather than separate and isolated products.. For instance, by popular demand, manga are often adapted into novels, novels into films, and films into games. Lofty online revenues from adapted works give content creators greater incentives, and give each work greater room for monetization. In this eco-system, having "killer" IP is the key to connecting to and attracting consumers. Therefore, the leading trend for developing copyright in the age of the Internet is to create "killer" IP content over the Internet, and a cross-platform entertainment eco-system to streamline various processes including funding, content creation, talent acquisition, promotion and marketing, sales and distribution, and the development of peripherals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition, companies must streamline their IP protection programs to maintain competitiveness in developing and monetizing copyright content. Tencent has set up a copyright management platform with comprehensive, complete and accurate records of Tencent's copyright content. This give Tencent an efficient way to collect, search and analyze all content-related information, so that each piece of copyright work can be clearly tracked.

                    Selling counterfeit and infringing products is against the law. If brands owners prove that a user is trading in counterfeit products, the user's WeChat account will be shut down permanently. If the user wishes to challenge the decision, the user may submit supporting materials to WeChat. WeChat will then deliver the materials to the respective brand owner for further consideration.

            <div class="news-content default-skin">
                <p>
                    Recently, we have been notified by brand owners that some WeChat users are using the platform to trade in counterfeit products. However, WeChat is not an e-commerce platform, and we are not equipped to identify counterfeit products from genuine items. As part of our anti-counterfeiting efforts, we must rely on users to report suspicious activity, and on the brand owners to verify whether the items involved are counterfeits. Thus, we have streamlined our Brand Protection Program to work closely with users and brand owners to crack down on counterfeiting on WeChat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Under our Brand Protection Program, we will partner with brand owners and allow users to submit information related to counterfeit products of these brands. This information will go directly to the brand owners, who will verify whether the products involved are counterfeits and inform us of their conclusion. Once we have confirmation that counterfeit products are being sold by a WeChat user, we will shut down that user's account. Throughout the process, the brand owners must represent and warrant that their verification and conclusions are legal and truthful.

                <p style="font-size: 10px">
                    Notes: we will accept applications from brand owners and launch the Brand Protection Program in April 2015.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are currently discussing potential collaborations with brand owners including Louis Vuitton, Adidas, Montblanc, and Cartier.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    At present, brand owners can use our offline reporting channel to enforce their rights. We plan to launch the online platforms in April at WeChat 110 (http://weixin110.qq.com/), where WeChat users report suspicious activity and brand owners can enter the Brand Protection Program.
